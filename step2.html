            <h2>How I Got a New Job as a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>After a year of consistent learning, I felt it was time to take the next step and look for a job in the field. I left my previous jobs, one of which was a stable position in the public sector, and decided to pursue this career. My plan was to learn as much as possible, apply a little every day, build as many projects as I could, and learn from my mistakes.</p>
            <p>I was never completely confident, especially since I still felt like I did not know everything I needed to, but I was confident that I would learn much more once I started working in a real development environment. When I applied for the job, I didnâ€™t have high expectations, but I was accepted. I got a full-time web developer job, but the salary was low at the beginning, as it happens in any field. The job is mainly focused on WordPress, with little advanced coding involved, but it's perfect for continuously learning and applying what I learn daily.</p>
            <p>I still feel like I have a lot to learn, but every step forward helps me become better and more confident in my skills.</p>
