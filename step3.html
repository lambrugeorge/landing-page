            <h2>What I Want in the Near Future and Why I Am Here in The Odin Project Course</h2>
            <p>In the near future, I want to accumulate much more knowledge, both from my current job and from this The Odin Project course. Although I had access to video tutorials in the past, many of them seemed too theoretical and hard to apply in practice. Now, through this course, I have started to understand much better how to structure and develop web applications.</p>
            <p>I'm glad I started working on this project, I created a landing page as part of the Flexbox exercises, and I can't wait to continue with the next lessons. These lessons are much more interactive and help me learn exactly what I need to become a more complete web developer.</p>
            <p>In this course, I’ve learned not only how to create websites but also how to structure them more efficiently and apply best practices. I feel much more prepared now and I’m excited to continue applying these lessons to my job and build a strong portfolio.</p>
